### Digoxin model

Digoxin PBPK predictions in children were evaluated using pharmacokinetic (PK) data reported in the following studies: 

- Ratnapalan S, Griffiths K, Costei AM, Benson L, Koren G. Digoxin-carvedilol interactions in children. J Pediatr. 2003 May;142(5):572-4.[[Ratnapalan 2003](#3-references)]
- Rane A, Wilson JT. Clinical pharmacokinetics in infants and children. Clin Pharmacokinet. 1976;1(1):2-24.[[Rane 1976](#3-references)]
- Nyberg L, Wettrell G. Pharmacokinetics and dosage of digoxin in neonates and infants. Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 1980 Jul;18(1):69-74.[[Nyberg 1980](#3-references)]

The pediatric PBPK model predicted the CL values of Digoxin observed in pediatric studies reasonably across all available age groups, ranging from 3 days to 8 years old. The ratios of mean predicted over observed CL values are illustrated in the table below as well as in the predicted versus observed CL ratio plot, showing that most predictions in children were within the 2-fold error range of observed values.
